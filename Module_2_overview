This project seeks to provide an image analysis pipeline that predicts and quantifies the extent of pulmonary fibrosis across different biopsy depths from the top of the lung. 
The pipeline will integrate line regression(interpolation) and scatter plot visualization to map fibrosis severity as a function of biopsy depth, supporting more precise and depth-resolved diagnostic evaluation of lung tissue.
