The goal of the project is to model COVID in China utilizing a SIRS model. 
Data on the growth of COVID-19 in China during the first phase of the pandemic is modeled utilizing an SIRS model and a grid search to optimize parameters.
The model created is used to predict the growth of COVID in China and this predictive model is compared to actual COVID development during the pandemic.
